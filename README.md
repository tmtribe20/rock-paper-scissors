# rock-paper-scissors
This is a JS game of rock paper scissors to show my understanding of javascript upto this point in the odin project course. There is lots of repeated code 
in the game at this point as we are only in the basic section of the course and not refactoring just yet. The game also only outputs to the console at
this point and does not display anything in index.html file as this is only used as a pointer to the game.js file.

## INSTRUCTIONS

Copy the index.html and game.js files to your own computer.

Point/run the index.html file in a browser of your choice and open the console to see the output of the game.

Any questions about the code let me know :).
